                  <h3>What is a Cover Letter?</h3>
                  <h6>A cover letter is a one-page document you submit alongside your resume or CV for your job application.</h6>
                  <h6>The main purpose of your cover letter is to:</h6>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Show your motivation for working at the company</li>
                    <li>Bring special attention to the most important parts of your work history</li>
                    <li>Explain how your work experience fits whatever the company is looking for</li>
                  </ul>
                  <h6>What your cover letter is NOT about, is rehashing whatever you already mentioned in your resume. Sure, you should mention the most important bits, but it should NOT be a literal copy-paste.</h6>
                  <h6>Keep in mind that the cover letter is usually read after the recruiter scans your resume and decides that you’re qualified for the position.</h6>
              </div>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
              <div class="col-md-6">
                  <h3>Why Use a Cover Letter Template?</h3>
               <h6>Your cover letter is just as (if not more) important as your resume.</h6>
                 <h6>After all, your resume is what gets your foot through the door, but a cover letter is what opens that door.</h6>
                 <h6>So, if you put so much effort into your resume, why not do the same for your cover letter?</h6>
                 <h6>A good cover letter template can show the recruiter that you’re serious about the job (especially if it matches your resume design).</h6>
                
              </div>
              <div class="col-md-3">

                  <h3>What to Include in Your Cover Letter?</h3>
                  <h6>Every good cover letter has the following sections:</h6>
                  <h6>Header - On top of the cover letter, you write down your own contact information, as well as the recruiter’s (recruiter name, company name, company address, etc…).</h6>
                  <h6>Greeting - A formal greeting for the recruiter. E.g. “Dear Sir or Madam,” To learn how to address your cover letter better, check out our article.</h6>
                  <h6>Opening paragraph - The introduction of your resume. Here, you summarize your background info (“financial analyst with X+ years of experience”), state your intent (“looking for X position at Company Y”), and summarize your 1-2 achievements to get the recruiter hooked.</h6>
                  <h6>Second paragraph - In the second paragraph, you explain how you’re qualified for the position and why the recruiter should pick YOU.</h6>
                  <h6>Third paragraph - You talk about why you’re a good match for the company. Do you share common values? Is the company working on projects you’re interested in? Etc…</h6>
                  <h6>Formal closing - Finally, you end the cover letter with a quick summary and a call to action (“I’m super excited to work with Company X. Looking forward to hearing from you!”).</h6>

               <h3>How to Write a Great Cover Letter?</h3>
               <h6>There’s a lot that goes into writing a great cover letter. If you want to get the full picture, you can check out our guide on how to write a cover letter.</h6>
                  <ul>Here are, however, some of the key takeaways:
                      <li>Avoid Fluff - You want to be as specific as possible with your cover letter. Avoid vague statements like “I’m a good fit for the company because I’m a good critical thinker!”</li>
                      <li>Do Your Research - Most companies don’t like people who “spray and pray” - applying for dozens of jobs without giving any much thought. What they ARE looking for is someone that’s passionate about their company, and wants to contribute. So, do your research about the companies you apply for, and show off your knowledge and passion in your cover letter.</li>
                      <li>Back Up Your Achievements with Data - When possible, back up your experience with data. Instead of saying, “I improved company revenue”, say “I managed to hit and exceed sales KPIs for 5+ months in a row.”</li>
                     
                  </ul>

              </div>
              <div class="col-md-6">
                  <h3>How Long Should a Cover Letter Be?</h3>
                  <p>Most recruiters agree that a cover letter should be brief and concise. It should be around 1-page max, within a 250 to 400 word range.</p>

               <h6>Instead of focusing on your work experience, you should talk about:</h6>
               
               <ul>
                  <li>Why you want to work for the company you’re applying for</li>
